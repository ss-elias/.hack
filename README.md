## Problem statement  
To develop technologies for disaster mitigation effort and risk management.  
## Solution  
Our solution encompasses all available utilities and resources under a single umbrella. Often times during calamities be it natural or man-made it is handled by various departments of the Govt and often results in mishandling of resources and lack of proper communication. Often times the victims of a disaster are clueless as to whom to contact and also face difficulty in getting resources and immediate relief.  
In our solution an affected person can find the nearest relief centre and also request for aid through this same channel.  
The govt body can also make a donation campaign and request for donation. The donations are decentralized meaning it ensures every fund and donation that is made to the Govt body is transparent and can be seen by everybody.  
It also ensures how the funds are used and whether there were any discrepancies during the fund distribution.
